Surf predictor. Does not have linear regression code uploaded yet, need to pull data from enough surfs first. Right now the proggram lets user input when they surfed and a rating of how good the surf was
and pulls all weather/tide data from the time inputed. This data along with the user inputed score will be plugged into the model to predict ideal surf conditions.
